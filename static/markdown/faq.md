### Why thirteen?
There are thirteen crafting professions that can be considered essential.

### How are decisions made? Who is in charge?
Falcao is our benevolent dictator for life, though decisions are made collectively. Disagreements can settled by a spontaneously formed council with a representative from each of the thirteen professions. (Whoever is on at the time.) A proxy can be elected by the present council if there is a quorum.

### Who benefits from guild organized trade runs?
The guild is not focusing gilda on anyone person, officer or otherwise. We provide trade ships, protection, and other infrastructure. Guild mates are encouraged to collaborate amongst themselves to prepare tradepacsk. Anyone can request a trade run. At which time the guild will escort you.
