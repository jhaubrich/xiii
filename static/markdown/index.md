> Men should be the masters of their own industrial fate, not tools rented by employers. -John Dewy

## Declaration
When it becomes evident that the current guild system has failed the majority by rewarding the few that govern -- enslaving those sworn to serve. A new union must be formed, and the old abolished.

Since this has become the case across all Nuian lands, five gentlemen have assembled to champion the cause of a new and fair union. An alliance of free groups of men and women based on cooperative labor and a planned administration of things in the interest of the community.
In this union we will provide every man three major areas of support in return for their pledge of service.

In return for his pledge of service every man will be offered fair market value for goods and services outside of their crafting professions, a guarantee of guild mates versed in those crafting professions, and eager response to any pirates. There is strength in numbers, but above all there should a fair trade system allowing all members the opportunity to push packs across the ocean for their own gain. 

In order for this system to be successful a strong and selective infrastructure must be put in place. The founders have assessed the craft and specialized skills and have determined that the strongest union exists in multiples of XIII.
